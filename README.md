# rocket-lander-homework
Adaptation of Ferrante's master's code for distinct rocket dynamics and parameters, plus a PPO(!?) controller

* Ferrante's work: https://github.com/arex18/rocket-lander

## Preliminaries

* Bidimentional 3-DoF dynamics, with yaw included
* PPO controller

## How to start

Start by downloading the required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt |
```

If it does not work, install each dependency separately. Then, run:

```
python3 main.py
```

~~(If we are problemless)~~ **Congratulations**, you have just landed a rocket!!

## Results

As can be observed, the rocket controller works fine
